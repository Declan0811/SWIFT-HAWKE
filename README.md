# SWIFT-HAWKE
Self-guided projectile system made with simple electronics.
I am very bad at documentation so this won't be the best
- The CAD files/STLs are on Printables - https://www.printables.com/model/596299-self-guided-projectile
- The bill of materials is in the BOM.txt
- General setup information is on the General.txt
